To disable video autoplay, the autoplay attribute needs to be removed altogether as this attribute. Setting autoplay=\"false\" will not work; the video will autoplay if the attribute is there in the <stream> tag. In addition, some browsers now prevent videos with audio from playing automatically. You may add the mute attribute to allow your videos to autoplay. For more information, [go here](https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/)."

The <video> element does not force the browser to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.
